## Data Science Projects

### Social Media Analysis (Sentiment Analysis+Risk Detection)

This project was conducted on Behalf of the Humberside Fire and Rescue with the aim of understanding the community perception by performing a sentiment analysis. The prject also aimed to develop a Artificial Intelligence model capable of that would be able to detect the risk in text that could be shared over social media posts this would enable them to take the initiative in resolving any developing situation. The data was collected using twitter API for any mention or hastag for the organization. There was several transformer used for experimentation along with the development of BiLSTM model. The risk detection model developed had an accuracy of 94%.


### Image Classification

This was a experimental project to perform an image classification for touristic landmarks images. During the project i have tested several pretrained models (VGG16, ResNET), SVM model, and CNN models. The images were scrapped from various internet site. The ResNET model had shown the best accuracy with the an accuracy of 98%.

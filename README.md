## Data Science Projects

### [Social Media Analysis (Sentiment Analysis and Risk Detection)](https://github.com/Amro6625/Social-Media-Analysis.git)

This project was conducted on Behalf of the Humberside Fire and Rescue with the aim of understanding the community perception by performing a sentiment analysis. The project also aimed to develop a Artificial Intelligence model capable of that would be able to detect the risk in text that could be shared over social media posts this would enable them to take the initiative in resolving any developing situation. The data was collected using twitter API for any mention or hashtag for the organization. There was several transformer models used such as(XLNET, RoBERTa) for experimentation along with the development of BiLSTM model. The risk detection model developed achieved an accuracy of 94%.

### [Landmark (Image Classification)](https://github.com/Amro6625/Landmark_Detection.git)

This was a experimental project to perform an image classification for touristic landmarks images. During the project i have tested several pretrained models (VGG16, ResNET), SVM model, and CNN models. The images were scrapped from various internet site. The ResNET model had shown the best accuracy with the an accuracy of 98%.

### [Accident Analysis](https://github.com/Amro6625/Accident_Project-.git)


This project investigates road traffic accidents in the United Kingdom in 2020, leveraging SQL relational databases for analysis. The data cleaning process addresses missing entries, focusing on key factors such as road surface conditions and junction details. Analysis reveals patterns in accident occurrences, highlighting peaks on Fridays and during the latter part of the workday. Specific attention is given to motorcycle accidents, pedestrian involvement, and the application of the Apriori algorithm to assess accident severity. Outliers are detected using the Local Outlier Factor method, emphasizing urban concentrations. The study concludes with the development of a stacking classifier for predicting accident severity and recommendations for enhancing road safety, including increased law enforcement presence, awareness campaigns, real-time traffic systems, and the adoption of machine learning models.

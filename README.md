Data Science Projects
Airbnb Scheduling Forecast
To help the booking of the Airbnb this data science project aim to create a machine learning model to predict the first booking of a new user. Unfortunately the database is very desbalanced which difficult the prediction of the model, the best result was 17.48% +/- 0.4% of accuracy. Therefore new approaches guided by the business will be necessary to improve the results.

Health Insurance Cross Sell
To help the sales team, this data science project was created to sort a list to improve the cross-selling. The model was able to organize that almost all interested customers (98.31% +/- 0.16%) stay on up to 50% of the list, saving half of the expenses incurred for calls. So, if each call costs R$ 15.00 in 20,000.00 there is an expense of R$ 300,000.00. Using the model it is possible to spend only R$ 150,000.00.

Transaction Fraud Detection
Financial transactions fraud is one of the biggest problems faced by financial institutions. Thus, this project uses data science and machine learning to detect and avoid fraudulent transactions. The model got a precision of 96.3% +/- 0.7% and a recall of 76.3% +/- 3.5%. The profit expected by the company is R$ 57,251,574.44.

Churn Prediction
When a client churns, it represents a problem, which results in money loss for the company. In this project, I created a solution using data to predict such behavior and avoid it. The machine learning model was able to detect 76.5% of the client which could churn, by using unseen data as example. It represents a recovery of R$ 2,878,197.97 for the company.

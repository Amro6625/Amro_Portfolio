# Credit Risk — Default Prediction

**Problem**  
Banks needed to assess loan default risk with higher accuracy, reducing false negatives.

**Methods**
- Engineered new features (DTI, credit utilisation, credit history length).  
- Split data into 80/20 training/testing.  
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.  
- Performed Grid Search + Cross-Validation for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Benchmarked against baseline models.

**Results**
- **AUC-ROC 0.85**, accuracy **78%**.  
- **15% improvement** over baseline accuracy.  
- **10% fewer false negatives**, catching more defaults.

**Business Impact**
- More reliable underwriting.  
- Reduced financial risk exposure.  
- Enhanced credit approval decisions.

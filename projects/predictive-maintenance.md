# Predictive Maintenance — IoT Telemetry

**Problem**  
Identify early signs of machine failure from multivariate sensors.

**Methods**
- Cleaned telemetry
- Engineered rolling/lag features
- Ensembles + survival analysis
- Early-warning thresholds
- Calibrated precision/recall

**Results**
- Recall 92% on early failure
- ~15% simulated downtime reduction

**Business Impact**
- Proactive scheduling
- Lower unplanned outages
- Higher reliability

**Code / Repo**  
*Demo repository planned*

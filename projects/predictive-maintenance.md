# Predictive Maintenance — IoT Telemetry

**Problem**  
Identify early signs of machine failure from multivariate sensor streams.

**Methods**  
Signal cleaning; rolling statistics; tree‑based classifiers and survival analysis; early‑warning thresholds; calibration for precision/recall.

**Results**  
Recall **92%** for early failure; ~**15%** downtime reduction in simulations.

**Business Impact**  
Proactive maintenance scheduling and reduced unplanned outages.

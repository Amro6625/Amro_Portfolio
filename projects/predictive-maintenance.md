# Predictive Maintenance — IoT Telemetry

**Problem**  
Factories needed to identify early signs of machine failure to reduce downtime.

**Methods**
- Cleaned and processed multivariate sensor telemetry.  
- Engineered rolling statistical features and failure windows.  
- Trained ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
- Added survival analysis to estimate time-to-failure.  
- Calibrated thresholds to balance precision/recall.

**Results**
- Recall **92%** for early failure detection.  
- Simulated downtime reduced by ~**15%**.

**Business Impact**
- Proactive maintenance scheduling.  
- Lower costs from unplanned outages.  
- Higher equipment reliability.

**Code / Repo**  
*Demo repository planned*

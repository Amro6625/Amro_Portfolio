# Landmark Detection — Image Classification

**Problem**  
Develop an accurate model to classify landmarks from photos for tourism and media applications.

**Methods**
- Collected and cleaned datasets of landmark images.  
- Applied data augmentation for robustness.  
- Trained VGG16, ResNet, SVM, and custom CNNs.  
- Compared performance under strict validation splits.  
- Tuned ResNet hyperparameters for optimal accuracy.

**Results**
- **~98% test accuracy** with ResNet.  
- Robust classification across multiple landmark types.  

**Business Impact**
- Automated tagging of tourist images.  
- Easier search and retrieval for travel platforms.

**Problem**  
Find severity drivers and predict accident likelihood for resource planning.

**Methods**
- SQL ETL and cleaning
- Time pattern analysis (e.g., Friday +20%)
- LOF anomaly detection (~5% outliers)
- K-Means to 10 hotspots
- Stacked RF+GBM+Logistic

**Results**
- Stacking accuracy 74%
- Baseline 68% acc / 70% precision / 65% recall
- Scenario sim suggests 15% fewer accidents with peak interventions

**Business Impact**
- Supports youth safety campaigns
- Guides deployment at junctions/peaks
- Evidence for policy

**Problem**  
Predict early machine failure to minimise downtime.

**Approach**  
Multivariate sensor processing; classification + survival analysis; early-warning thresholds; calibration for precision/recall balance.

**Impact**  
**92% recall** on early failure prediction; **~15% downtime reduction** via proactive maintenance scheduling.

**Stack**  
Python, scikit-learn, time-series toolkits.

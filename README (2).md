## Selected Projects (Case Studies)

### 1) Social Media Analysis — Sentiment & Risk Detection (Humberside Fire & Rescue)
**Problem:** Identify public sentiment and proactively flag potentially risky social posts related to emergency services.  
**Approach:** Collected 5.5k+ tweets via Twitter API; experimented with transformer models (XLNet, RoBERTa) and a custom BiLSTM. Deployed robust preprocessing, class balancing, and threshold calibration.  
**Impact:** **Up to 94% validation accuracy** on risk detection, enabling faster response prioritisation and better situational awareness.  
**Stack:** Python, Pandas, PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit‑learn, NLP toolkits.  
**Links:** [Repository](https://github.com/Amro6625/Social-Media-Analysis)

### 2) Credit Risk Analysis — Default Prediction
**Problem:** Improve loan default prediction to reduce risk exposure and false negatives.  
**Approach:** Engineered features (DTI, utilisation rate, credit history length). Evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting; tuned via cross‑validation and grid search.  
**Impact:** **AUC‑ROC 0.85, 78% accuracy**; **reduced false negatives by ~10%**, materially improving risk identification and underwriting decisions.  
**Stack:** Python, Pandas, scikit‑learn, PyCaret, Matplotlib/Seaborn.

### 3) Predictive Maintenance — IoT Telemetry
**Problem:** Anticipate machine failure to minimise unplanned downtime.  
**Approach:** Processed multivariate sensor data; trained classification and survival models; implemented early‑warning thresholds and calibration.  
**Impact:** **92% recall** for early failure prediction; **~15% downtime reduction** via proactive scheduling.  
**Stack:** Python, scikit‑learn, time‑series toolkits.

### 4) Recommendation System & Search Optimisation
**Problem:** Increase conversion and relevance in product discovery.  
**Approach:** Built **hybrid recsys** (collaborative + content‑based + deep learning), improved search ranking, and instrumented online A/B tests.  
**Impact:** **+30% retrieval accuracy**, **+20% conversions**, **‑40% pipeline latency** after optimisations.  
**Stack:** Python, scikit‑learn, NLP, implicit/LightFM (or equivalent), API layer.

### 5) UK Road Traffic Accident Analysis
**Problem:** Understand patterns and drivers of accident severity in UK 2020 data.  
**Approach:** SQL ETL, data cleaning, clustering (K‑Means), anomaly detection (LOF), Apriori for association patterns, and a stacking classifier for prediction.  
**Impact:** Actionable insights (e.g., Friday/late‑afternoon peaks, junction‑heavy incidents). Built a predictive model to support resource allocation.  
**Stack:** SQL, Python, scikit‑learn.  
**Links:** [Repository](https://github.com/Amro6625/Accident_Project-.git)

### 6) Landmark Detection — Image Classification
**Problem:** Classify touristic landmarks from web‑scraped imagery.  
**Approach:** Benchmarked VGG16/ResNet, SVM, and custom CNNs; implemented systematic augmentation and validation.  
**Impact:** **~98% test accuracy** with ResNet on curated dataset.  
**Stack:** PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit‑learn.  
**Links:** [Repository](https://github.com/Amro6625/Landmark_Detection.git)

## How I Work
- Start with the **business outcome**, translate to measurable ML objectives, and choose data/metrics that matter (AUC, F1, cost‑aware metrics).  
- Prioritise **clean, reproducible code** and **clear evaluation** with honest baselines.  
- Where possible, **deploy** quick demos (Streamlit/Flask) and add CI for lint/tests.  
- Communicate results with **interpretable visuals** and **pragmatic recommendations**.

**Problem**

**Approach**  
Feature engineering (DTI, utilisation, history length), models (LogReg/RF/Gradient Boosting), cross-validated grid search, cost-aware thresholding.

**Impact**  
**AUC-ROC 0.85, 78% accuracy**; **~10% fewer false negatives**, improving risk identification and underwriting decisions.

**Stack**  
Python, scikit-learn, PyCaret, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
